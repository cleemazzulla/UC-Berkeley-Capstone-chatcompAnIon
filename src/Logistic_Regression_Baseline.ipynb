I learned that blog posts (with cat pictures on top) are not specs some years ago oh so you mean 1 to 9 makes 3? it doesn't make sense to scale a pixel in just one direction unless I'm missing something yeah, so 1 to 9 makes 3 I think I understand it correctly as I explained above you could file a bug report http://bugs.opera.com/ I suppose the latter\", merged_text_id=\"9fdcde97c1cb33fe4e9f6aab1d84bc76: e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0: can I have your ear? 9fdcde97c1cb33fe4e9f6aab1d84bc76: e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0: i am wondering if Opera implements, or plans to implement safari's &quot;device-pixel-ratio&quot; css media query. would you know? 9fdcde97c1cb33fe4e9f6aab1d84bc76: yes 9fdcde97c1cb33fe4e9f6aab1d84bc76: e.g. 1 CSS pixel to 3 device pixels would be 3.0 9fdcde97c1cb33fe4e9f6aab1d84bc76: it's one-dimentional 9fdcde97c1cb33fe4e9f6aab1d84bc76: well it's explained here http://webkit.org/blog/55/high-dpi-web-sites/ 9fdcde97c1cb33fe4e9f6aab1d84bc76: though hyatt hasn't written up a formal defn i think 9fdcde97c1cb33fe4e9f6aab1d84bc76: no 9fdcde97c1cb33fe4e9f6aab1d84bc76: the ratio is applied in both directions 9fdcde97c1cb33fe4e9f6aab1d84bc76: think of it as the sqrt of the difference in number of pixels 9fdcde97c1cb33fe4e9f6aab1d84bc76: or better yet, think of it as the zoom factor 9fdcde97c1cb33fe4e9f6aab1d84bc76: 200% zoom would produce a factor of 2.0  (i.e. 2.0 squared more pixels per image) 9fdcde97c1cb33fe4e9f6aab1d84bc76: okay :) 9fdcde97c1cb33fe4e9f6aab1d84bc76: so I'm guessing opera doesn't support it yet. who would be the person to speak to about getting it implemented? 9fdcde97c1cb33fe4e9f6aab1d84bc76: where to? 9fdcde97c1cb33fe4e9f6aab1d84bc76: should I request an account or use the plebeian option? 9fdcde97c1cb33fe4e9f6aab1d84bc76: ok a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 - do you have any set of test cases for non-conformant HTML5? a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 - btw, do you have a good estimate of many man hours you have put into work on the conformance checker? a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: ... including hours of any others that contributed to it significantly (fantasai, maybe?) a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: I'm just curious a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 - OK.

I figured that much you ever hooked up with anybody from the net before? many people?Your going to be the 2nd one I have met some bi sexual chick from Santa Cruz about 3 years ogo when we first got together we just jumped straight into bed and were only fuck buddies for about 1 and a half years she was all right-had real long hair that went past her ass when we first met being just fuck buddies and her living out in Santa Cruz wasnt a reralationship that was ment to last long.Out of the bed we were tottally different people both who just wanted a sex partner yes,I did.But I didnt mind it since I like to drive about 2 years younger than me but when we met she told me that she wanted to have her first bi sexual reralationship soon and that things with us werent going to last forever which I all ready knew that would be an ex Brenda from Morgan Hill who I was with before I met the girl in Santa Cruz 10 and will be 11 in April Brendas cool about things with him.She lets him come over anytime that sucks.You have any brothers or sisters? at least you have her to talk to when things around there with your mom and dad are not going good but when he calls or comes over they fight? they arent physically abusive are they toward you? probably she just has a lot on her mind being a single parent thats allways fun were do you usually hang out-friends or in town? huh/ ? tats wat I thunk u sed now this plan of ours right,friday night but you allowing me to eat your pussy and all right when we first get together are you a virgin? been with an older man around my age before? have you ever had someone eat you before? and when we are together your absolutely sure that your not going to trip out when I just get down on my knees and stick my head between your legs-even if it happens unexpectedly? you like that idea do you? what else do you think is hot that you may like to have happen? you been tied up and fucked before? what do you think of the idea? what about 69? you suck dick before? tasted cum? ever had your tits fucked and cum shot all over you? really?it looks like you have a nice set of tits ever tried annal sex? not yet-so that tells me your pretty open minded about things when it comes to sex I might just get a hotel room for friday night yes,I will but want to fuck you without one on and just pull it out and come on your belly not that way they do it all the time like thatin xx rated flicks come on you not in you you like em/ ? thats how they keep from getting pregnant nope but I wiould like to make one with you sure-you want to ?I can bring a camera we can just set it up on a dresser pointing at the bed yeah,if its cool with you will you finger your self so I can watch? yes,while sitting in a chair with a leg over each arm rest so I can see everything right on you like being called names while fucking? I dont know some chicks like being called a slut or whore bitch all kinds of things its not anythings special I would rather b talking about how I much I am enjoying being up your tight cunt I will remember that then dont think I have ever been called anything but a fucker and thats while I was diong it as in \"oh,you fucker harder\" \"Oh,you fucker stick it in deeper\" yes but mainly fat you dont get sore after a short period of sex do you? most likely you asked if I am going to hurt you no,I am not just going to bend you over and ram it in I will be fingering you while I am licking and nibbling on your clit what do you like/ ? what do you want name it and you will have it and coke? no problem you smoke cigs? theres a lot of things your not supposed to do but we will do em anyways can you hang on a sec someones here and I need to get rid of em brb back they only wnated to borrow a cd what can you bring? that would be a nice touch.Have any baby oil? but mainly just bring yourself and wear that mini skirt with no panties but you have the skirt right? a top might be cool since you might get in trouble going out with just a skirt on just bring yourself baby girl thats all that matters then everything will be just fine something I want to ask has anyone ever just walked up and started having sex with you right away? kinda like what I want to do I guess that the idea turns you on then I am probably going to get things going with you on our way to the hotel room I will most likely reach over and start fingering you yes,while we are traveling to the hotel well the rv is most likely going to be a back up place to go I will probably get a room at motel6 dont need to they are never that crowded I am going to ask for 1 with 2 beds so as far as they know your my kid and we are spending the night and sleeping seperately you want to ? well see how are you wearing your hair is in a pony tail or still like in the pic? pony tail it I can get an easier grip on it like that yes,I do drive myself in deep and hard have a favorite position? so you probably like it flat on your stomache too ever done it while spooning? thats my favorite just thought of something for you to bring if you feel that you want to be tied up wear some pant hose/nylons if not thats fine too you dont have any plans for saturday do you? good because when I am through with you friday night saturday morning your going to be walking funny lol just so you know I have asked you alot of questions here any thing you want to ask me? anything at all? roommates who will be here they would trip hard once they realize we arent just playing cards in my room I wish but they pay rent to and have every right to be here 2 yes sending you a file picture Image Hosted by ImageShack.us let me know when you look at it told you I have a fat head stretch you out a little is all the fact that you have a hot body and are real sexy I like the most and that turns me on-major catch myself looking at them all the time and I have to remind myself that they are young I like the petite sexy figures God no never wpould I am still having a hard time getting used to the fact I am going to be with you you get far with him? and what is it about older guys that you like? maturaty-sexual experience? or the fact that they fuck you hard like you want it k understandable since your sexy they are intimadated and afraid they arent good enough alot of guys think that a sexy girl like you is maybe stuck up and wouldnt even like being around most boys feel like they arent good enough that you would want some dude who could model for some mag that all make sense? good you ever been in trouble with the law before? is that all cause you said that the cops threatened you with juvy thats nothing now I dont wnat to go to jail for sex with a minor so give me a YES or No answer ok?
