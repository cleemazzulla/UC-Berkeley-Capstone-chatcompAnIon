I'm just curious b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 - OK. Was just thinking mainly about the HTML5 part, and thinking it might be good to eventually try to have an rough estimate of how many man hours are needed to implement a complete HTML5 conformance checker. b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 - OK One thing I wonder is, given all the dependencies of your Java implementation, how much extra work it will be to try to implement a checker in another language. other languages which I guess maybe are likely to lack equivalent libraries to depend on b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 - yeah, I know. about the schemas, seems like it would probably not be the most productive approach to try to implement something in another language that didn't also rely partly on schema validation http://www.elementary-group-standards.com/html/html5-doctype-is-unrecognized.html Sean Fraser I reckon I should probably add his feed to the nascent HTML5 blog aggregator OK, added him http://people.w3.org/mike/planet/html5/ any others anybody's aware of that ought to be there, let me know a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: there are some in the syntax module a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: I've also used Anne's WF 2.0 tests, but using those in the test harness in now broken as the spec stabilizes it makes sense to write more tests a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: no estimate. lots a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: the upper bound I can give is that there's no code written by me in there that predates October 2003. And the validation service started around November 2004, IIRC. Work towards applying it to HTML began in the summer of 2005. The November 2004 date is my guess about starting design and implementation. it wasn't public until 2005 a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: I cannot give an estimate that would be even remotely accurate. But I can say that the parser isn't the biggest part, so the reasoning &quot;we have a parser in language foo, let's make a conformance checker&quot; is missing the point a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: the biggest question is if you another programming language plus the same schemas or a totally independent impl a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: but it is going to be a lot of work. I'm far from considering the Java impl complete afk &quot;Sean Fraser posted this on January 22, 2007 08:30 AM.&quot; he does post a lot about it seems only fair s/only fair/correct/ lol that's the ration between CSS and normal pixels? ratio* that could be useful euh 1 to 4 makes 2 sounds more logical anyway, if it's defined somewhere it might make sense to look into it one-dimentional? I learned that blog posts (with cat pictures on top) are not specs some years ago oh so you mean 1 to 9 makes 3? it doesn't make sense to scale a pixel in just one direction unless I'm missing something yeah, so 1 to 9 makes 3 I think I understand it correctly as I explained above you could file a bug report http://bugs.opera.com/ I suppose the latter\", merged_text_id=\"9fdcde97c1cb33fe4e9f6aab1d84bc76: e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0: can I have your ear? 9fdcde97c1cb33fe4e9f6aab1d84bc76: e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0: i am wondering if Opera implements, or plans to implement safari's &quot;device-pixel-ratio&quot; css media query. would you know? 9fdcde97c1cb33fe4e9f6aab1d84bc76: yes 9fdcde97c1cb33fe4e9f6aab1d84bc76: e.g. 1 CSS pixel to 3 device pixels would be 3.0 9fdcde97c1cb33fe4e9f6aab1d84bc76: it's one-dimentional 9fdcde97c1cb33fe4e9f6aab1d84bc76: well it's explained here http://webkit.org/blog/55/high-dpi-web-sites/ 9fdcde97c1cb33fe4e9f6aab1d84bc76: though hyatt hasn't written up a formal defn i think 9fdcde97c1cb33fe4e9f6aab1d84bc76: no 9fdcde97c1cb33fe4e9f6aab1d84bc76: the ratio is applied in both directions 9fdcde97c1cb33fe4e9f6aab1d84bc76: think of it as the sqrt of the difference in number of pixels 9fdcde97c1cb33fe4e9f6aab1d84bc76: or better yet, think of it as the zoom factor 9fdcde97c1cb33fe4e9f6aab1d84bc76: 200% zoom would produce a factor of 2.0  (i.e. 2.0 squared more pixels per image) 9fdcde97c1cb33fe4e9f6aab1d84bc76: okay :) 9fdcde97c1cb33fe4e9f6aab1d84bc76: so I'm guessing opera doesn't support it yet. who would be the person to speak to about getting it implemented? 9fdcde97c1cb33fe4e9f6aab1d84bc76: where to? 9fdcde97c1cb33fe4e9f6aab1d84bc76: should I request an account or use the plebeian option? 9fdcde97c1cb33fe4e9f6aab1d84bc76: ok a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 - do you have any set of test cases for non-conformant HTML5? a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 - btw, do you have a good estimate of many man hours you have put into work on the conformance checker? a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: ... including hours of any others that contributed to it significantly (fantasai, maybe?) a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: I'm just curious a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 - OK. Was just thinking mainly about the HTML5 part, and thinking it might be good to eventually try to have an rough estimate of how many man hours are needed to implement a complete HTML5 conformance checker. a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 - OK a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: One thing I wonder is, given all the dependencies of your Java implementation, how much extra work it will be to try to implement a checker in another language. a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: other languages a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: which I guess maybe are likely to lack equivalent libraries to depend on a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 - yeah, I know. about the schemas, seems like it would probably not be the most productive approach to try to implement something in another language that didn't also rely partly on schema validation a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: http://www.elementary-group-standards.com/html/html5-doctype-is-unrecognized.html a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: Sean Fraser a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: I reckon I should probably add his feed to the nascent HTML5 blog aggregator a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: OK, added him a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: http://people.w3.org/mike/planet/html5/ a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: any others anybody's aware of that ought to be there, let me know b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: there are some in the syntax module b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: I've also used Anne's WF 2.0 tests, but using those in the test harness in now broken b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: as the spec stabilizes it makes sense to write more tests b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: no estimate. lots b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: the upper bound I can give is that there's no code written by me in there that predates October 2003. b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: And the validation service started around November 2004, IIRC. b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: Work towards applying it to HTML began in the summer of 2005. b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: The November 2004 date is my guess about starting design and implementation. it wasn't public until 2005 b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: I cannot give an estimate that would be even remotely accurate. But I can say that the parser isn't the biggest part, so the reasoning &quot;we have a parser in language foo, let's make a conformance checker&quot; is missing the point b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: the biggest question is if you another programming language plus the same schemas or a totally independent impl b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9: a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: but it is going to be a lot of work.

I learned that blog posts (with cat pictures on top) are not specs some years ago oh so you mean 1 to 9 makes 3? it doesn't make sense to scale a pixel in just one direction unless I'm missing something yeah, so 1 to 9 makes 3 I think I understand it correctly as I explained above you could file a bug report http://bugs.opera.com/ I suppose the latter\", merged_text_id=\"9fdcde97c1cb33fe4e9f6aab1d84bc76: e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0: can I have your ear? 9fdcde97c1cb33fe4e9f6aab1d84bc76: e3fb62ebfa4f36acf5cbff6a6ed0f2e0: i am wondering if Opera implements, or plans to implement safari's &quot;device-pixel-ratio&quot; css media query. would you know? 9fdcde97c1cb33fe4e9f6aab1d84bc76: yes 9fdcde97c1cb33fe4e9f6aab1d84bc76: e.g. 1 CSS pixel to 3 device pixels would be 3.0 9fdcde97c1cb33fe4e9f6aab1d84bc76: it's one-dimentional 9fdcde97c1cb33fe4e9f6aab1d84bc76: well it's explained here http://webkit.org/blog/55/high-dpi-web-sites/ 9fdcde97c1cb33fe4e9f6aab1d84bc76: though hyatt hasn't written up a formal defn i think 9fdcde97c1cb33fe4e9f6aab1d84bc76: no 9fdcde97c1cb33fe4e9f6aab1d84bc76: the ratio is applied in both directions 9fdcde97c1cb33fe4e9f6aab1d84bc76: think of it as the sqrt of the difference in number of pixels 9fdcde97c1cb33fe4e9f6aab1d84bc76: or better yet, think of it as the zoom factor 9fdcde97c1cb33fe4e9f6aab1d84bc76: 200% zoom would produce a factor of 2.0  (i.e. 2.0 squared more pixels per image) 9fdcde97c1cb33fe4e9f6aab1d84bc76: okay :) 9fdcde97c1cb33fe4e9f6aab1d84bc76: so I'm guessing opera doesn't support it yet. who would be the person to speak to about getting it implemented? 9fdcde97c1cb33fe4e9f6aab1d84bc76: where to? 9fdcde97c1cb33fe4e9f6aab1d84bc76: should I request an account or use the plebeian option? 9fdcde97c1cb33fe4e9f6aab1d84bc76: ok a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 - do you have any set of test cases for non-conformant HTML5? a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 - btw, do you have a good estimate of many man hours you have put into work on the conformance checker? a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: ... including hours of any others that contributed to it significantly (fantasai, maybe?) a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: I'm just curious a9b326df4e6da61c5b6f5e1058be83a2: b8810fee2f4a71f849f3f7409546d1d9 - OK.

So what do you like to do for fun? Besides this game…. I like to skateboard. See that’s sexy. I love girls who skateboard. Do you go around here? Yes, sometimes to the park. We should go together sometime. I’m not really sure about that. My parents said I shouldn't meet strangers. Well I’m not a stranger still. We are friends right? I guess so. Maybe I can get your number and we can get to know each other better through text? Ok 845-375-3754. Make sure you don't tell your parents.</td>\n",
